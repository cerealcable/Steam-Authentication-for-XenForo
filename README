Steam Authentication & Integration
  A XenForo Addon

== Description ==
Authenticate to your XenForo forum with Steam! Steam Authentication & 
Integration allows new and existing users to establish accounts via 
their Steam accounts using the Steam Web API. There are additional 
features such as: Steam statistics for your users; Generate notices 
for users based on steam data (ex. notices for people who own a 
specific game); Create trophies based on steam data (ex. trophy for 
associating a steam account to your xenforo account). Best of all, 
there are no template edits required!

This addon is a continuation of the original Steam Authentication & 
Integration addon created by Morgan. If you have this version installed 
already, you can upgrade to this addon without the need to re-install.

== Configuration ==

>> IMPORTANT <<

Make sure that you have a STEAM API KEY entered into the configuration 
options. This addon will NOT function properly without a valid API key.

>> /IMPORTANT <<

If you choose to display the steam statistics navbar tab, make sure to 
also give allow permissions to the appropriate user groups or users. 
Otherwise, they will not be able to view statistics. Permissions can be 
changed under the Users section in the ACP.

The same goes for steam profile banners. Permissions need to be 
configured to display them to users/groups.

== Troubleshooting ==
Please do not ask me (HowIChrgeLazer) directly for help via a Conversation. 
Unless you have sensitive information to share (which you shouldn't share 
with me anyways) then don't make a conversation and instead post in the 
resource discussion! It also provides public documentation for others in 
case they have similar issues.

  Steps to take BEFORE asking for help:
    * If you are using files from the develop branch on GitHub
      I use GitHub as a way to track my progress and save my edits as I 
	  develop the addon. There will be some occasions where commits to develop 
	  branch will break features of the addon, or break it entirely. If you use 
	  files from that branch, you do so at YOUR OWN RISK. I will accept bug 
	  reports, but I will not support the develop branch of the addon.

    * Read your log files
      Don't know where they are or what they mean? Well then this is a good time 
	  to research. You should be familiar with your forums environment before 
	  installing an addon (and if you are not, you should become familiar or 
	  consider contracting the work).

    * Read the entire description & readme file
      They contain instructions and hints which you may have missed or need to 
	  do before you can continue.

    * Read the resource discussion (available on the XenForo Community / Releases)
      It is possible that someone else probably already has experience the same 
	  exact issue. Go hunt through the thread to see if that is the case.

    * Ask your question in the discussion!
      If none of the above solved your problem, ask your question in the 
	  resource discussion. I'll answer any questions there, and if you start a 
	  conversation asking for help with your installation, I'll only tell you to 
	  post in the discussion thread. I will try to respond in the discussion, 
	  I promise.

== Known Issues / Fixes ==

* SteamProfile not loading after quick reply or editing a post *

This is an issue with how XenForo loads this content. I'll have to look into 
this further and see if there is a fix. There is no known method at this time.

* Problems displaying user activity in Firefox *

Firefox will not correctly report last seen on any page that has the SteamProfile 
javascript.

* Failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized *

This means that a SteamAPI key has not been configured or is invaild. 
Please read the configuration section for information on getting the API 
key configured.

* Name or service not known *

This can happen if you're having DNS issues with your webserver. Make 
sure steam community URLs can resolve correctly.

== Like this Addon? ==
Awesome! Leave a review and tell me how much you like it and why! Feedback is
important so you might as well give it so those who develop for this addon can
make it better and others can see your opinions.
