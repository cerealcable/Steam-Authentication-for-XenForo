Installation and Usage
----------------------

Extract archive to desired location on your webserver. The directory `cache` is used for caching, therefore it must be read- and writable for the webserver.

You can change configurations for the XML proxy in `xmlproxy.cfg`. For client configuration and template editing, open `ajax/steamprofile.xml`.

See the files in the `examples` folder for examples and instructions for proper embedding into your website.
